IPv4: 32 bit field, 4.2bn addresses
IPv6: 128 bit field, 340 undecillion addresses

Domain registrar: Authority the can assign domain names directly.
	Domain names are registered with InterNIC, as service of ICANN which enforces the uniqueness of domain names across the internet. Domain name becomes registered in a central database called WhoIS

Start of authority Record(SOA):
	Name of the server
	Administrator of the zone
	Current version of the data file
	TTL - Length a DNS record is cache(in seconds)

NS Records:
	Name server record
	USed of TLD servers to direct traffic to Content DNS server which contains the authoritative DNS records

A Record:
	Address Record
	Translate name of the domain to IP address
	PTR records is just reverse of this

CName:
	Canonical Name
	Used to resolve one domain name to another
	Can't be used for naked domain names, it must be either an A record or an Alias

Alias Records:
	USed to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to ELBs, CloudFront or S3 buckets
	Work like CNAME in that you can map one DNS to another target DNS name.

MX Records:
	Used for emails

Routing Policies:
	Simple Routing:
		One record with multiple IP addresses
		Route53 returns all values to the user in a random order
	Weighted Routing:
		Split your traffic based on weights
	Latency Based Routing:
		Route traffic based on the lowest network latency
		Create a latency resource record set for the Amazon EC2 in each region that hosts your website
	Failover Routing:
		Active/Passive Setup
		Route53 will monitor the health of your primary site using health check
	Geolocation Routing:
		Choose where traffic will be sent based on the geo location of your users.
	Geoproximity Routing:
		Traffic flow only Mode
		Route traffic based on geographic location of your users and resources
		Option to choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifyin a bias value
	MultiValue Answer Routing:
		Return multiple values such as IP addresses
		Also lets you check the health of each resource so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources
