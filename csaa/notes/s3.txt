simple storage service

Object based storage
0 bytes to 5TB
Unlimited storage
Files stored in buckets

Universal namespace
Global view but buckets can be created in individual regions
You can change storage classes and encryption settings on the fly

HTTP 200 code if upload is successful

Objects:
	Key - Name of the file
	Value - Simply the data
	Version ID - Able to do version control
	Metadata - Data about date you are storing
	Subresouces
		ACLs
		Torrents

Supports MFA delete

Data consistency:
	Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects - Upload a file to S3, read it immediately
	Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(takes some time to propagate) - This means if you upload a new version of file, the instant read after the operation might still retrive an older version but after sometime(probably a second or two) it will get the updated version

Guarantees:
	built for 99.99% availability
	guarantees 99.9%
	99.99999999999% durability

Storage Classes:
All tiers have 99.99999999999% durability
	S3 Standard:
		99.99% availability
		99.99999999999% durability
		designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently
		First 50TB/month - $0.023/GB
		Next 450TB/month - $0.022/GB
		Over 500TB/month - $0.021/GB
	S3 - IA: Infrequent access
		Lower fee than s3 but charged a retrieval fee(How much is this?)
	S3 One Zone - IA: Previously S3 RRS, reduced redundancy storage
		No multiple AZ data resilience
		Cost - $0.01/GB
	S3 - Intelligent Tiering:
		Optimizing costs by automatically moving data across tiers, uses machine learning
		Infrequent access tier costs($0.0125/GB) are roughly half of frequent access but comes with additional monitoring and automation cost($0.0025/1000 objects)
	S3 Glacier:
		Archival purposes
		Secure, durable and low cost
		Retrieval from minutes to hours
		Cost - $0.004/GB
	S3 Glacier Deep Archive
		Lowest cost where data retrieval takes 12 hours
		Cost - $0.00099/GB

Costs:
	Storage - How much data is stored
	Requests - How much data is accessed
	Storage management - Based on tiers
	Data Transfer pricing
	Transfer acceleration - Fast, easy and secure transfer over logn distances between bucker location and end users, uses aws cloudfront edge location. If turned on, files are uploaded to edge location to speed up transfers
	Cross region replication - Bucket in Region 1, replicate to another bucket in Region 2

By default public access is blocked

Restricting bucket access - Security:
	Bucket policies - bucket level
	Object policies - individual object level
	IAM policies to Users and Groups - User and group level
	Can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to bucket. These can be written another bucket.

Encryption:
	Encryption in transit:
		SSL/TLS
	Encryption at rest(server side):
		S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
		AWS KMS, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
		Customer provided keys - SSE-C
	Client side encryption
	Can edit encryption on individual object level or a global bucket level

Versioning:
	Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspend. Existing versions can only be deleted individually
	Integrates with life cycle rules
	MFA delete capability

	Each version needs to be made public individually

	Delete just hides the objects

Lifecycle rules:
	Can limit scope using file prefixes or apply to all objects
	Transition needs to be in storage classes order described above
	Can be used in conjunction with versioning

S3 Object Lock:
	Store objects using WORM, write once read many
	Prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a specific time or indefinitely

	Governance Mode:
		Users can't overwrite or delete or alter lock settings unless the user has special permissions
	Compliance Mode:
		A protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, even root user. For the duration of retention period. And retention period can't be shortened
	S3 stores expiration timestamp in metadata

	Legal Hold:
		Legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted. But has no retention period and in effect until removed
		Freely placed and removed by users with s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission

Glacier Vault Lock:
	Deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 glacier vaults with Vault Lock policy(such as WORM)
	Lock objects inside glacier
	Policy can be locked and once locked cannot be changed

S3 Performance:
	S3 Prefix:
		mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/file1.ext -> /folder1/subfolder1 -> This is the prefix
		3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE per second per prefix
		5500 GET/HEAD per second per prefix
		Better performance by spreading across different prefixes

	If using SSE-KMS, keep in mind KMS limits
	Upload calls GenerateDataKey in KMS API
	Download calls Decrypt in KMS API

	Uploading/Downloading will count toward KMS quota. Quota is region specific(either 5500, 10000 or 30000 per second) and this cannot be increased

	Multipart Uploads:
		Recommeneded for files over 100MB
		Required for over 5GB
		Parallelize uploads, splits into parts and uploads in parts

	S3 Byte Range fetches:
		Parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges

S3 Select:
	Retrieve only subset of data using simple SQL expressions
	Upto 400% faster and 80% cheaper
	Get data by rows or columns using SQL expressions

Glacier Select:
	Run SQL queries against Glacier directly

Cross account access:
	Bucket policies and IAM - Programmatic access only
	Bucket ACLs and IAM - Programmatic access only
	Cross account IAM roles - Programmatic and console access

Cross Region Replication:
	Versioning required on both source and destination buckets
	Doesn't do it for existing objects, only for new objects
	Now public permission from source also replicates to destination
	Delete markers are not replicated by default. Option in configuration to do so.

AWS DataSync:
	Move large amount of data to AWS from On prem data center
	Uses DataSync Agent
	S3, AWS EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows - NFS/SMB
	Hourly, daily or weekly
	Can also be used to replicate EFS to EFS

CloudFront:
	Content Delivery System
	Edge Location - Where content will be cached
	Origin - Origin of all files. S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance, ELB, Route53
	Distribution - Name given to CDN
	If edge does not have the data, it will download from origin and store for however long as configured, time to live(TTL).
	This becomes really usefull for the next user who needs that data.
	Cached objects can be cleared but you will be charged
	You can also upload to edge locations

	Web Distribution - For websites
	RTMP - Adobe Flash Media Streaming - This has been discontinued on Dec 31, 2020

	Cannot see two types now, directly goes to config page

	Signed URLs and Cookies:
		Signed URL is for individual files. 1 file = 1 URL
		Signed cookie is for multiple files. 1 cookie - multiple cookies

		Attach a policy:
			URL Expiration
			IP Ranges
			Trusted Signers (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs)

		Uses OAI, origin access ...

		Client -> Auth > Application <--> use SDK to generate signed URL <--> CloudFront <--> S3

		Generation of signed URL is key paid and managed by root user

S3 Signed URL:
	Issues a request as the IAM user who creates the presigned URL
	Limited lifetime

If users can access S3 then it is S3 signed URL, else if using OAI it is cloudfront signed URL
If origin is EC2, then use cloudfront

Snowball:
	Petabyte scale data transport solution. Import/Export.
	50TB or 80TB
	Snowball edge - 100TB, onboard storage and compute capabilities. Can cluster together
	Snowmobile - Exabyte scale data transfer. 100PB. Semi truck.

Storage Gateway:
	Connets on-prem software appliance with cloud based storage
	Available for download as a VM image. Supports VMWare ESXi and MS Hyper-V
	File Gateway - NFS/SMB - Flat files, stored directly on S3
	Volume Gateway - iSCSI - 
		Stored Volumes - Store primary data locally, backing up that data to AWS in the form of EBS volumes. 1GB-16TB volume sizes
		Cached volumes - Uses S3, most frequently accessed data. Upto 32TB and attach them as iSCSI devices. 1GB-32TB volume sizes
	Tape Gateway - VTL - Virtual Tape Library - Durable cost-effective to archive data in AWS

Athena:
	Interactive query service which enables you to analyse and query data located in S3 using standard SQL.
	Serverless, nothing to provision, pay per query/per TB scanned
	Query log files stored in S3
	Generate business reports on data stored in S3
	Data Formats: JSON, Apache ORC, Apache Parquet

Macie:
	Discover PII - Personally identifiable information
	Home address, Email, SSN, DL etc.,
	Uses ML and NLP to discover, classift and protect sensitive data stored in S3
	Great for PCI-DSS
	Can also analyze CloudTrail logs
